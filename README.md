# ShaderView, a shader renderer

ShaderViewer is a simple utility to render glsl shader with the minimum overhead and setup posible,
it will pass to the shader some uniforms but won't do anything else.

### Made with some code from the website http://www.opengl-tutorial.org

### Future features
Autogenerate uniform stubs in glsl shader to guarantee compatibility with ShaderToy shaders

Add FPS counter and window size label
